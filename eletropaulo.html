    <h1>Electricity bill</h1>
    <div class="service graphic"></div>
    <p>
      This project was about getting an everyday object and quickly coming up with a new proposal, using the design methods. I chose the electricity bill as something we all get in touch once a month and is a source of pain and frustration for a lot of the users. I deeply believe that putting more design effort in small things like this can make life significantly less painful for all of us.

    <h1>The process</h1>
    <p>This was a sprint project, intended to be an exercise for exploring the tools in each of the design process' phases. We went all the way from problem framing, user understanding, technology and context researching, and synthesis, to design requirements, ideation, sketching, model-making, and composing the final layout with fine attention to information architecture and typography. </p><img src='/img/eletropaulo/eletropaulo-4.png'>
    <p>
      An electricity bill, even though is delivered on printed media, is such an important touchpoint in the costumer’s experience that it can be considered the product itself. Understanding how people use this product is an essencial step to ease their experience with the company, especially when what they're being sold is something as abstract as energy. 
      
    </p>
    <p>
      In a visit to my grandpa’s house, I asked him to show me his last electricity bill, and performed an informal user test where I asked him to find some information in the document. He paused to get his reading glasses in a drawer, and was impressively good at finding key information in the bill. He said, though, that the type was indeed too small and that he had trouble reading the smaller information. 
      
    </p>
    <p>
      He also showed me his method of knowing which bills were already paid: he pays them in the bank branch, so the paid ones always have an receipt stapled to them. Stapled = paid.
      
    </p>
    <p>
      Another important information from this visit was the way he stored the bills: In a A4 file, together with other service bills (which vary in format, but most come in sizes similar to A4s. If they're larger than that, they have to be folded in half and thus are harder to retrieve information from.

    <p>
      This new “strip” bills are being adopted by all major distributers in Brazil. The reason is that the way it works here, a company’s employee needs to come over to your house, read the meter with a special instrument, and then send that information to the company, which then sends you the bill via mail. The new thermographic printer, in the pictures above, makes it possible for the employee to print the bill instantly and put it himself in your mailbox, reducing a lot of the time and resources necessary to deliver the bill to every costumer.
      
    </p>
    <p>
      The problem with these printers is that they have a limited color output (monochromatic), a low resolution of 200dpi, very bad register which prints things off in almost every case, and uses thermographic print which comes off easily after some time. The strip is 10cm wide.

    <p>
       I had never tried to design something with this much information on it - especially so many numbers, tables, acronyms, and technical stuff. It was a great way to learn some typographic rules we sometimes take for granted, like how you should write dates, how to compose and align numbers in tables, and how you should shorten technical terms and values. At first, it seems that we're looking too close and that some details won't matter. Seeing everything together, though, proves how many small improvements can make an overall experience significantly better.
