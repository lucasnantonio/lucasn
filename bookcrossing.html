    <h1>Bookcrossing experience redesign</h1>
    <div class="service ux graphic"></div>
    <p>Bookcrossing.com is a website dedicated to this global movement was founded in 2001, and it currently has over 1,855,000 members and 9,710,000 books registered. The website offers a free system of labelling  and registering the books, so users can keep track of where their books have gone to, and who has read them.</p>

    <h1>A new generation, keen to sharing</h1>
    <p>
      During our research, focused on Generations X and Z’s habits and opinions on sharing, we've found that there is a strong movement towards collaborative consumption. Interviewees were very prone to lending and passing on objects that were not in use anymore. On the example below, we asked participants to stick coloured labels on objects, depending on their preference to own, rent, or share them with others. We've found that the newer generations are much more open to sharing then the older ones such as 'Boomers', to whom owning things and keeping them private is more natural.

    <h1>Designing a new business model</h1>
    <p>
      Bookcrossing works on a freemium model, and struggles to generate value and maintain itself, as most users stick to the free accounts. Mapping out the stakeholders was helpful to find new ways in which BC could increase income.

    <h1>Identity redesign</h1>
    <p>
      In order to create more presence in the minds and hearts of the young generations, while still remaining relevant for long-time users, the identity redesign kept but refreshed the iconic running book. The changes are not solely aesthetic: The new shape maintains legibility and recognition in smaller reductions, and also allows placement in coloured backgrounds. I also felt bad about the fact that the original book is running to the left, so it was flipped to run “forward”.

    <h1>Experience mapping and website analysis</h1>
    <p>
      Even though youngsters were very attracted to the idea of bookcrossing, when presented with the current website and experience flow they were immediately set back, giving overall negative feedback on the way it looks and the way it works in practice. The main points were confusion about the 'rules' and terminology used by users, overwhelming due to the complex website architecture, and lack of a mobile friendly and more streamlined experience for registering and releasing books.

      Reviewing the website’s architecture enabled a big reduction of page numbers and user paths.

    </div>
    <p> Mapping the current experience showed a number of pain points that could be solved by upgrading the involved technology, such as mobile integration, the use of QR codes for tagging, geolocalization and book registration based on barcode databases.</p>
    <h1>Embracing existing behaviour</h1>
    <p>
      The tags were designed to mimic an existing behaviour caused by the old version. Since it was glued on the inside of the book, there was no indication on the front that the book was free to pick up. People then felt the need to add something, usually a sticky note with a message. This design also caused some people to never notice the label inside the book. The proposed version folds over from the inside, at the same time making it obvious that the book is free, and giving a visual clue that there is something that follows inside.

    <p>First prototypes of labels that use QR codes as a quicker way of registering </p>
    <h1>Creating value</h1>
    <p>The new tags continue to operate on the freemium model offered before: They're free to download, but the new black and white design can be printed in coloured paper if the user wants to.  This same layout can be printed in premium coloured paper, and packed nicely to be sold in independent bookshops, hostels, and official bookcrossing zones, fitting on the ideal price range for gifting. </p>

    <h1>Embedding technology</h1>
    <p>The original flow for registering and releasing books was clumsy and long. QR code and Barcode integration makes registering a book an on-the-go, one-step process, where before the user had to input multiple fields on the website, at home, before they could go to the wild and release the books. These feature, is, of course, optional, and the users are still given the BCID codes if they wish to add books manually.</p>

    </div>
    <p>Geotagging allows users to get notifications once they get close to books they want to read</p>
    <p>Bookcrossing is a great example of how we don't need to keep coming up with novel ideas all the time in order to create change. A lot of good ideas are already out there, and just need some more attention to be explored in their full potential. </p>
